### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thomas Karmann, a systems and software engineer and hobby musician, currently living in Berlin (DE). 

I'm a generalist but I mainly do:

- *Systems engineering* for linux-based datacenter- and cloud environments
- *IT Operations* and *Site Reliability Engineering*

I started with Linux Administration in early 2000s and after school studied Computer Science at FAU Erlangen, but have since then moved on to different topics:

- System programming using C/C++, Python, Typescript and GoLang
- Web-development (Zope, Flask, FastAPI)
- Built large-scale device provisioning software for ISPs based on CWMP/TR-69
- Kubernetes (bare-metal, rancher, EKS) setup and optimization
- Development Operations and Infrastructure as Code (CFEngine, Ansible, Terraform, CDK, helm, kustomize)
- Observability
