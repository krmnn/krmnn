### Hi there üëã

My name is Thomas Karmann and I'm a **systems engineer** and hobby **musician**, currently living in Berlin (DE). 

I view myself as a generalist, but I mainly do 
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Systems engineering** for Linux and UNIX datacenter environments
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud engineering** for AWS environments
- üßØ **IT Operations** and **Site Reliability Engineering** in any environment

I started to fiddle with Linux in early 2000s and, after school, studied Computer Science at [FAU](https://cs.fau.de/) with focus on Operating Systems, Computer architecture and Virtualization. Since then I have moved on to different topics:

- **DevOps** and **Infrastructure as Code** 
  - Fluid in all major configuration systems and IaC ecosystems like CFEngine, Ansible, Puppet, Terraform, HCL, AWS CDK, Helm, kustomize, python
  - Kubernetes (bare-metal, Rancher, EKS) design, setup and optimization
- **System- and Webprogramming** using C/C++, Python and GoLang
  - for ISPs building large-scale provisioning flows for CPEs and routers using CWMP/TR-69 and SSH
  - for IXPs building monitoring components like prometheus exporters
  - for Webshops using Zope, Flask, FastAPI, Nodejs, Typescript
- **Observability** (Monitoring, Logging, Tracing)
  - Prometheus, Prometheus Federations, Grafana, VictoriaMetrics for scraping, storing and visualizing system- and business-metrics
  - Elasticsearch/Opensearch + vector.dev for scrapiong, storing, searching and visualizing large amounts logs
  - Nagios, Icinga for legacy environments

I currently work for [@idealo](https://github.com/idealo) on observability topics.
