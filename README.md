### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas Karmann and I'm a **systems engineer** and hobby **musician**, currently living in Berlin (DE). 

I view myself as a generalist, but I mainly do 
- **Systems engineering** for Linux and UNIX datacenter environments
- **Cloud engineering** for AWS environments
- **IT Operations** and **Site Reliability Engineering** in any environment

I started doing Linux Administration in early 2000s and, after school, studied Computer Science at [FAU](https://cs.fau.de/), but have since then moved on to different topics:

- **DevOps** and **Infrastructure as Code** 
  - fluid in all major configuration systems and IaC ecosystems: CFEngine, Ansible, Terraform, HCL, AWS CDK, Helm, kustomize, python
  - Kubernetes (bare-metal, Rancher, EKS) design, setup and optimization
- **System- and Webprogramming** using C/C++, Python and GoLang
  - for ISPs and IXPs, building large-scale CPE provisioning flows for CWMP/TR-69
  - for Webshops using Zope, Flask, FastAPI, Nodejs, Typescript
- Handling **Observability topics** (Monitoring, Logging, Tracing)
  - Prometheus, Prometheus Federations, Grafana, VictoriaMetrics for scraping, storing and visualizing system- and business-metrics
