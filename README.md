### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas Karmann and I'm a systems and software engineer and hobby musician, currently living in Berlin (DE). 

I view myself as a generalist, but I mainly do **Systems engineering** for linux-based datacenter- and cloud environments, **IT Operations** and **Site Reliability Engineering**.

I started doing Linux Administration in early 2000s and, after school, studied Computer Science at [FAU](https://cs.fau.de/), but have since then moved on to different topics:

- System programming using C/C++, Python and nowadays GoLang
- Web-development (Zope, Flask, FastAPI, Nodejs, Typescript)
- Built large-scale device provisioning software for ISPs based on CWMP/TR-69
- Development Operations and Infrastructure as Code (CFEngine, Ansible, Terraform, CDK, helm, kustomize)
- Kubernetes (bare-metal, rancher, EKS) setup and optimization
- Observability (Monitoring, Logging, Tracing)
