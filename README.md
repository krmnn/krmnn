### Hi there üëã

My name is Thomas Karmann and I am a **systems engineer**, currently living in Berlin, Germany. 

I do:
- üßØ **IT Operations** and **Site Reliability Engineering**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Systems engineering** for Linux and UNIX datacenter environments
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud engineering** for AWS environments

I started to fiddle with Linux in early 2000s and, after school, studied Computer Science at [FAU](https://www.fau.eu/) with focus on Operating Systems, Computer architecture and Virtualization whilst working as System Administrator for the department. After I received my diploma I moved on to various topics:

- **Platform Engineering** and **Infrastructure as Code** 
  - Fluid in all major configuration systems and IaC ecosystems like CFEngine, Ansible, Puppet, Terraform, HCL, AWS CDK, Helm, kustomize, boto
  - Kubernetes (bare-metal, Rancher, EKS) architecture, configuration and optimization, building integrations
  - Code and Deployment Pipelines using GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins
- **Softwaredevelopment** using C/C++, Python and Typescript
  - for ISPs building large-scale provisioning flows for CPEs and routers using CWMP/TR-69 and SSH/netmiko
  - for IXPs building monitoring components like prometheus exporters
  - for Webshops using Zope, Flask, FastAPI, Nodejs, Typescript
- **Observability Engineering** (Monitoring, Logging, Tracing, Alarming)
  - Prometheus, Prometheus Federations, VictoriaMetrics and Grafana for scraping, aggregating, storing and visualizing large amounts of system and application metrics in distributed systems
  - Logstash, Vector and Elasticsearch/Opensearch for collecting, aggregating, storing, querying and visualizing large amounts of system- and application logs in distributed systems
  - Nagios, Icinga, Munin for legacy environments

I currently work for [@idealo](https://github.com/idealo) on observability topics.

If I touch computers in my free time I am busy with:
- creating and recording music using DAWs, instruments and controllers
- learning to code DSP and audio software, plugins
- DIY projects, home automation
